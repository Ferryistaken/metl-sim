# Energize argument files
This directory contains argument files for [energize.py](../code/energize.py). 
An argument file can be used by calling `python energize.py @arg_file.txt`.
You can still specify command line arguments in addition to the argument file. 
Argument files are convenient for record keeping, reproducibility, and HTCondor runs.
